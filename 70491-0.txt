      Let them in on every side.
    And with this delightful band,
      Take a stroll through Elfin-Land._

    MY LADY WEARS A PRETTY TRAIN,
      THAT REACHES FAR, AND STRETCHES WIDE,
    AND SILK OR SATIN THOUGH IT BE,
        THE WHOLE GRIMALKIN FAMILY
            WILL CUT BEHIND AND TAKE A RIDE.




THE MAN IN THE MOON

[Illustration: Man in the moon]


    The man in the moon once had a wife,
      And she was really the plague of his life.

    They used to sail in a bright canoe,
      From east to West, o’er the sky so blue.

    But she was restless and he was rough,
      And said he hadn’t half room enough.

    One night in turning the boat around,
      The woman fell out, and she was drowned.

    And down in the lake she sails alone
      In a lovely boat that is all her own!

[Illustration: Woman in boat]




A Very Handsome Mermaid.

[Illustration: Three fish]


    A VERY HANDSOME MERMAID,
      FATHER NEPTUNE’S ONLY DAUGHTER;
    HAS A VERY LOVELY BOWER.
      ALL HER OWN, BENEATH THE WATER.

    SHE HAS SLAVES TO DO HER BIDDING;
      ALL THE BIG AND LITTLE FISHES,
    BRING HER JEWELS WITHOUT NUMBER,
      AND PREPARE HER DAINTY DISHES.

    WE HEAR ABOUT HER GRACEFUL FORM,
      THE CHARMS WITH WHICH SHE’S LADEN,
    BUT NO ONE YET HAS EVER SEEN
      THIS WONDERFUL SEA-MAIDEN.

[Illustration: Mermaid and fish]




The Peacock’s Train.

[Illustration: Girl dressed up]


    _The peacock spreads his brilliant train,
      And struts about with pride,
    No other bird seems quite so vain,
      In all the regions wide._

    _Each plume is like a sparkling gem,
      Of rich and radiant dyes;
    Some cherub must have painted them,
      And all those shining eyes._

    _And if I had as fine a gown
      As his, upon my word
    I’d strut a little, up and down;
      And be as vain a bird._

[Illustration: Boy painting a peacock’s feathers]




[Illustration: Starfish]

THE DANCE ON THE BEACH


    A star-fish stood on the sandy shore
      To list to the seaside band.
    As with rumble-tumble dash and roar
      The waves swept over the land.

    The man in the moon from his binnacle soon
      Suspended the beacon-light.
    “Aha!” cried the star-fish, full of glee,
      “I’ll have a nice dance to-night!”

    A jig and a hornpipe all alone
      He danced to a lively tune.
    And capered about with his shadow there
      In the silvery light of the moon.

    Then up came others by twos and twos,
      Some of them real old salts.
    Who danced the Polka, Virginia Reel,
      And the new Society Waltz.

    With twinkling feet they skipped about
      Like elves on the shining sand,
    And kept good time to the rhyme and chime
      Of the famous seaside band.

    They danced and capered, and skipped and tripped.
      As merry as they could be,
    Till the tide came up with a sudden rush
      And swept them into the sea.




[Illustration: Girl sitting]

The Bee’s Mistake.


    _A little girl by the name of Rose,
        In a quiet corner sat.
    When a honey-bee sailed round and round
        The rim of her garden-hat._

    _Said the bee, “ah me! so sweet a flower
        I haven’t beheld to-day!”
    And he came so near to the pretty Rose,
        That she screamed as she ran away._




A Light Headed Family

[Illustration: Three heads under parachutes]


I.

    An excellent family, every one said,
    But rather too airy and light in the head;
            Why, it was a fact
            Good judgment they lacked,
    And many, yes, many were certainly cracked!


II.

    There was Mrs. Henpen with a very stiff cap;
    And Master Gooseloose—a remarkable chap;
            And Mr. Foochoo
            With a very long cue,
    And Bo-peep, and Dorking, and little Boy-Blue.


III.

    They made up a party to visit the moon,
    Each member to furnish a private balloon;
            They said, “We will fly
            Along through the sky,
    And anchor ourselves to the stars by and by.”


IV.

    That they had any brains there is reason to doubt,
    For the wind blew a gale on the day they set out,
            And Foochoo, don’t you see,
            Was caught fast in a tree!
    Oh never was Chinaman madder than he!

[Illustration: Face growing on tree]


V.

    They wanted to stop, but they couldn’t, you know,
    For, having once started, they just had to go;
            And lightly they soared,
            And strange countries explored.
    But they hadn’t the least bit of ballast on board.


VI.

    Now over the hills they went thumpety-thump!
    ’Gainst each other’s heads they went bumpety-bump!
            Now here and now there,
            But it didn’t much scare
    This light-headed family, I do declare!


VII.

    A furious gust blew them all in a bunch;
    “How jolly!” cried Mrs. Henpen. “Let’s have lunch!”
            Ah, she was too rash!
            There soon was a crash!
    And the light-headed family all went to smash!

[Illustration: Sunflowers]




THE SUNFLOWER DANCE.

[Illustration: Girl dancing]


    “COME, DANCE WITH ME!” THE SUNFLOWER SAID,
      TOSSING HIS LOCKS ABOUT,
    TILL THEY STOOD LIKE AN AUREOLE ROUND HIS HEAD.
      “LET’S DANCE ’TILL THE STARS COME OUT!”

    HE LED THE WAY, AND IN SINGLE FILE
      THEY DANCED THROUGH THE FIELDS OF CORN;
    WHILE THE SUN WENT DOWN WITH A CHEERFUL SMILE,
      AND LAUGHED WHEN HE ROSE NEXT MORN!

[Illustration: Fairies on rainbow]




Seven Little Fairies.


[Illustration: Rainbow]

    Seven little fairies came
      When the storm was ended;

    Seven little fairies came
      Drest up very splendid!

    Hand in hand they marched along,
      Keeping close together;

    Driving gloomy clouds away,
      Bringing back clear weather!

[Illustration: Boy caught turtle with fishing rod]




Which Shall Win?

[Illustration: Boy riding turtle]


    Johnny was a little boy, but he had a wish
      When he went a-fishing, to haul in the biggest fish;
    Hook and line so strong as his, surely could not fail,
      Johnny thought, to catch a shark, or perchance, a whale.

    Early on a rainy day, Johnny on the shore
      Felt a tugging at his line, never felt before;
    Then he straightened up, and said, opening wide his eyes,
      “Cracky! now I guess I’ve got something like a prize!”

    Johnny pulled and tugged away; then he gave a look;
      Saw a monstrous turtle fastened firmly to his hook;
    Took a firmer hold and said, “Which of us shall win?
      I must either pull you out, or you’ll pull me in!”

[Illustration: Two women talking]




Little Dame Pansy.

[Illustration: Pansy on a wall]


    LITTLE DAME PANSY PUT ON HER BEST BONNET,
      THERE WASN’T A RIBBON OR FEATHER UPON IT,
    AND WALKING ALONG THROUGH A PATH THAT WAS SHADY,
      SHE HAPPENED TO MEET WITH A VERY OLD LADY.

    THIS VERY OLD LADY, THERE WAS NO DENYING,
      WAS VERY MUCH TROUBLED, HER CAP-STRINGS WERE FLYING.
    “O DEAR MISTRESS PANSY!” SHE CRIED, “I’LL GO CRAZY!
      FOR SOME ONE HAS STOLEN MY LOVELIEST DAISY!”

    “YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL!” THE LITTLE DAME PANSY
      MADE ANSWER, “THAT SOME ONE HAS TAKEN A FANCY
    TO SOME OF YOUR CHILDREN. DON’T BE IN A PASSION!
      FOR DAISIES, YOU KNOW, ARE THE TIP OF THE FASHION!”




Bad Luck.

[Illustration: Girl eating from a pan]


    _A little Brittany maid
    Who never wore gowns of silk,
        Sat down all alone
        On a great round stone,
    With a nice bowl of bread and milk._

    _A pert little magpie came,
    His saucy respects to pay.
    “Good luck!” cried the maid,
      Not a bit afraid
    “I shall have good luck all the day!_”

    _Then ere she had ceased to laugh,
    For she was a merry soul,
        She looked again,
        And saw very plain
    Two magpies perched on her bowl!_

    _The maiden began to cry
    “Alas! and alack-a-day!
        ’Tis surely a sign
        Bad luck will be mine!
    Bad luck”!—and she ran away._




A VERY POLITE LITTLE BOY.


    I knew a little boy
      So exceedingly polite;
    He wouldn’t leave the room, unless
      He asked you if he might;
    His hair was always smooth,
      And he looked so spick and span,
    You really might have thought
      He was a wooden little man!

    One day as he began
      To remark, “Sir, if you please—”
    Intending to apologize
      If he should chance to sneeze;
    Quite suddenly he gave
      A funny little shriek,
    And everybody jumped into
      The middle of next week.

    And the little boy himself,
      Very nearly died of fright:
    Because he’d been so very
      Very, very impolite!

[Illustration: Boy bowing]




THE FAN-TRIBE.

[Illustration: Tribe dancing]


    _O far away by a tropic sea,
      And near to a jungle dell.
    Neath the scorching rays
      Of the sun’s bright blaze,
    The fan tribe Indians dwell._

    _No silken, satin or velvet gowns,
      No laces do they possess,
    But from year to year,
      They always appear
    In this fantastic dress._

[Illustration: Children with wings]




    The moon has a host of children
      That never are seen by day;
          But Oh! in the night
          ’Tis a pretty sight,
    To see them frolic and play.

    They harness the stars together,
      And over their race-course ride;
          Or gather in crowds
          On the fleecy clouds,
      And down on the moonbeams slide.




A Lily-Race.

[Illustration: Indian kids in canoe]


    A swarthy son of a savage race,
      A brave young Indian lad,
    Set out from shore in a light canoe,
      His foot on a lily-pad.

    His oar was only a slender rush,
      He managed with native grace,
    And he hurried along, for close behind
      Another had given chase.

    Together they darted adown the stream,
      Each poised in his light canoe,
    ’Till in their strivings to keep ahead,
      Their oars were broken in two.

    And that was the end of the lily-race;
      For soon with a savage roar,
    The Indian boys jumped into the stream,
      And both of them swam ashore.

[Illustration: Indian boys in lily-pads]




THE JAPANESE FAMILY

[Illustration: Japanese family]


    SAID MR. JAPANESE TO MRS. JAPANESE,
      AS HE AND SHE HAD A TALK,
    ON A PLEASANT SUMMER DAY,
      “SHALL I GET A RIK-I-SHAY?
    OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE WALK?”

    SAID MRS. JAPANESE TO MR. JAPANESE,—
      AH, SHE WAS A CLEVER SOUL!—
    “IF I CAN HAVE MY WAY,
      YOU’LL NOT GET A RIK-I-SHAY,
    BUT WITH THE CHILDREN TAKE A QUIET STROLL.”

    SO MR. JAPANESE AND MRS. JAPANESE
      AND THE LITTLE JAPANESES TOO,
    SET OUT IN INDIAN-FILE,
      IN THE VERY LATEST STYLE,
    WITH THEIR EYES AND MOUTHS PRODIGIOUSLY ASKEW.

    THROUGH GARDENS TRIM AND NEAT, TO SMELL THE BLOSSOMS SWEET
      THEY GO, AND OVER FENCES CLIMB,
    AND WHEN THEIR WALK IS DONE,
      THEY CRY OUT, EVERY ONE,
    “WE’VE HAD A LOVELY JAPAN-EASY TIME!”

[Illustration: Japanese family]

[Illustration: Girl in bed with flowers]




TULIPS.


            Tulips bright in the garden beds,
              Lift up their heads;
            No other blossoms are as gay
              And proud as they.

    But I know where some tulips grow.
      Ah, Yes, I know!
    More rich and sweet than any flower
      In garden bower.

    “Good morning!” say my tulips red,
      As out of bed
    They spring; and other tulips greet
      With kisses sweet.

            And that is why I love them so,
              You ought to know;
            And tulips you may likewise find
              To please your mind.

[Illustration: Fairy boys painting flower]




[Illustration: Nuns praying]




PRETTY LITTLE NUNS.


    PRETTY LITTLE NUNS IN THEIR PURPLE HOODS.
        LIFT THEIR LITTLE FACES FAIR.
    IN THE LONELY CORNERS OF THE QUIET WOODS;
        AND MAKE A LITTLE CHAPEL THERE.

    AND PRETTY LITTLE NUNS IN THEIR PURPLE HOODS,
        MEET IN LITTLE CLUSTERS, WHERE
    THEY LISTEN TO THE MUSIC OF THE GRAND OLD WOODS
        AND REVERENTLY KNEEL IN PRAYER.




A Garden Party for Three.


    UP IN AN APPLE-TREE CORNER SAT,
      A LITTLE GIRL AND A PUSSY-CAT.
    JUST AS COSY AS THEY COULD WISH,
      EATING OUT OF A CHINA DISH.

[Illustration: Girl feeding cat in tree]

    CLOSE BESIDE THEM A BIG BLACK CROW.
      SAUCY AND THIEVISH HE WAS, YOU KNOW—
    CAME AND PERCHED, SAYING “O DEAR ME!
      WHAT A NICE GARDEN PARTY FOR THREE!”

    THE LITTLE GIRL HAD ENOUGH TO EAT;
      THE CAT AND THE CROW HAD A ROYAL TREAT;
    AND SOME OTHER DAY IN THE APPLE-TREE
      THERE’LL BE A NICE GARDEN PARTY FOR THREE!




_BLACK-EYED SUSAN._

[Illustration: Girl walking through flowers]


    _Little black-eyed Susan
      Through the meadows went
    Pretty little Sukey-Sue!
      To visit her Grandmother
    Was the little maid’s intent,
      And to wish her a “how-de-do?”
    Little black-eyed Susan
      Was a clever child;
    Pretty little Sukey-Sue!_

    _And to every one who came along,
      She courtesied and she smiled,
    With a nice little “how-de-do?”
      Little black-eyed Susan
    Stopped awhile to rest;
      Pretty little Sukey-Sue!_

    _When a lot of funny little folks,
      In black and yellow drest,
    Popped up, and said “why! how-de-do?”
      Little black-eyed Susan,
    Pretty courtesies made;
      Clever little Sukey-Sue!
    And nodding to the other
      Black-eyed Susans, sweetly said,
    “I’m pretty well. Pray how are you?”_




VERY ÆSTHETIC.

[Illustration: Girl pulling a sunflower]


    No limpy-and-lanky maid,
      No skimpy-and-cranky jade.
    This dear little queer little elf;
      But wherever you find her,
    She is dragging behind her,
      A Sunflower as big as herself!

    At children too rude and robust,
      She turns up her nose in disgust.
    Yes, she turns up her little nose.
      So Æsthetic; she couldn’t,
    She declares, and she wouldn’t,
      Be seen with such creatures as those!




THE SEND OFF.


    _Now ye merry madcap elves,
      Trim the bonny boat yourselves;
    Weigh the anchor, loose the sail;
      So ’twill catch the favoring gale,_

    _Then away with songs to greet
      Every other craft you meet;
    Scattering joy on every hand,
      From the shores of Elfin-Land._

Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg™ License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
